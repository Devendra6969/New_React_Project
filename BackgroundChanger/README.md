# Background Color Changer 🎨

This is a fun project I built while learning **React**. It allows you to change the background color of the page by clicking on different buttons.

## 🌟 What this project does
- Displays a floating navigation bar at the bottom of the screen.
- Uses **React State (`useState`)** to update the color instantly.
- Uses **Tailwind CSS** to layout the buttons evenly using Flexbox and Gap.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **React.js** (for logic)
- **Tailwind CSS** (for styling)

## 🚀 How to Run locally

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
